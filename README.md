# Videoparty

Watch videos together. Videoparty synchronizes video playback for multiple people, so that everyone can watch the video together.

The video needs to exist on everyone's computer.

## Design

This is done using a control API to control the player and synchronizing with a server. Currently `mpv` player is supported.
